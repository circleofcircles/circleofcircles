The spirtuality gate
=======

# Who is this book for:

Do you know the feeling when you come back from work, or wake up in the morning - and ask yourself, why am I doing this? what is this all for, and what this all means? You start to ask this question other people some of them quite smart,  but you either get obviously wrong answers (i.e. you're here to surve the masters i.e. god/s), or obviously stupid (to make money, to have as much pleasure as you can), or obviously meaningless (you're here to seek the answer, to discover the truth, to be enlightened). 

Well if you know this feeling, and you're tiered of all the bulshit answers out there - this book is for you. We're trying to understand it outselves, without making any shortcuts, and you're welcome to join this path with us. 

# How one should think about the ideas here:

We realized for a while now, that every individual is very different from other individual. Not only in his genetics givens or in his history who were his parents, how he grew up, and from what social background he is. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Every individual has internal complex structure of his counssiosness, of things that he believes in, in things he's interested in, in things where he feels "himself". The internal world of every individual is quite unique and different, it "feels" different for every person, and I mean "very" different. 

On the other hand we found out that many "tips" for self explorations can help identify those differences between self and others, and allow people to see more clearly their own truth, which can be formulated as their perception of themselves and others (including reality). 

So basically this is not a holly scripture, rather than continious atempt to understand and realize who we are and part of what we are, and how do we deal with this knowledge and how do we change ourselves in the direction that we chose to take and explore. 

If some idea of this book doesn't work for you - we're encoureging you to speak, to think with us on how to improve it, to join the effort by criticising, listening, give improvement suggestion, as well as taking responsibility for your truth by developing your path of viewing the reality further, together with us. 

# Why is this important: 

When you're lost - the first thing you're looking for is a map. Having a map of a new place, you will already feel much more comfortable in it rather than just hope there from a plane. This is book is our best atempt to find, share and aknowledge our map. 

For example before you're leaning a new topic, wouldn't it be more effitient to know how to learn rather than just reading a bunch of books, wasting a lot of time on not interesting topics, in order to understand a adeep answer to your question? Isn't more effitient to just learn how to make shortcuts so that you'll be able to learn a lot, but focused on what you want to know? 

Think that before you want to learn how to learn, you want to know that learning is the answer at all? When you get into this deeper self exploration, maybe you've been told to learn a lot, but you should dance a lot instead? And maybe you should dance some specific dance instead of starting from ballet? This is kind of "meta" skills that one can develope and transfer to other areas in life. 

# What is the "ideal" mental state: 

Many traditions had discovered a long time ago a concept which can be called - unawareness. This is when we're in a regular state of mind responding automatically, without trying to trully figure out what is goind on. If you know some people who became religious, they can tell you they discovered "the light". This is actually true, they moved their counsseness from a state where everything is automatic to a state where evreything is new and fresh, and part of a big story. They suddenly have a role in the play, a new role in a new play. But when time is passing, the role is not new and the play is not new - and they basically return to the same place they started from i.e. they discover it's the same role in the same play. 

Yet still somehow religions had disvored this secret ingredient to human counsseness which should be embraced and learned from. This is a state where you have a map of yourself rather than just moving with the flow. A state where you actually more aware of what's going on. The problem is that being part of any story, of any play will give you this feeling - and chosing your role and your play is harder than it seems. And what's more important it's that we want to help you to chose your role in your play, not a role in our play. 

Bascially the ideal state of mind is having a life which are part of a story that you trully chose to be part of, realizing all the consequences of that choice, while playing a role you know you want to play. 

# How do we achieve this state:

First we believe in systematic hard work over magic. I'm not saying that some words or expiriences can't take you to a new level, rather than thinking some magic will happen to you and everything will change, and all the bad stuff will disapear forever. It's a skill rather than a realization or an expirience, a skill you develop bit by but until you get where you want to be. 

Develpoing this skill takes time and learning effort. Like a muscle that takes time to develop and master to some satisfying level. The best way to develop this skill is by starting to work on it, developing it and to make mistakes, fail and analyze. Like any other skill. 

Another important source of information is other people. Everyone around you can give you interesting input of their own perspective, and can help you growth. This includes also books, movies, courses etc. 

# Main practices

## Fundamentals

- Daily practice. 
- Long range goal setting. 
- Learning from mistakes and adapting. 
- On the fly practicing.
- Dialectics. 

#### Establishing baseline.
* Meditation (14 steps practice)
* Goal setting in the morning, and day analysis in the evening. 
* The same as above on higher cycle basis (once a week, month, year). 

#### Long range goal setting. 
* Having a good view of core values. Developing the skills to reflect upon them, and adapt them. 
* Finding different goals of different time scale, that correspond with these core values.
* Reflecting upon those goals on a regular basis to be on track. 

#### Learning from mistakes and adapting. 

* We make a lot of mistakes, without realizing them we will repeat them. We can use reflection and analysis to learn to avoid them. 
* We may change and think differently than previously, we should be able to adapt and change our course toward new destination. 
* While we think we know how we make decisions we usually wrong about that. Learning to make thoughtful decisions is a skill. 

#### On the fly practicing.

* We have constant challenges in our life, we can treat them as mental puzzles reality creates for us. One can develop the skill to view, reflect and adapt different life situations into such puzzles
* We can create exercise from those situations, or on the contrary view every situation as on the fly life leasson to be learned. 
* We can challenge ourself with on the fly challenges which will take little focus but with great value. 
* We can use our meditation practices, to solve and learn in the constant flow of daily routine. 
* We can also just notice that we couldn't solve the puzzle online, and take it off line (i.e. learning from mistakes). 

#### Dialectics. Learning from resistance. 

* We can learn from books, movies and passive stuff, they can still challenge us intellectually, morally spiritually. 
* Many times other people can challenge us and our world view, we should learn and invest in deep dialogs with others. 
* We sometimes don't understand ourselves. Many times at different mood or state of mind we think different things, this is dialectics with onself. 
* The reality is sometimes stronger than our assumptions and expectations of it as of ourselves. Reality can challenge us many times more than friends and books and even more than ourselves. This mainly includes new expiriences which we gain through exiting the comfort zone. 

## Communication 

Other people is a very reach source of self improvement. The different between communication and the other areas is that communication is symmetrical, on the other side there is another conscious entity as we're, that can change us as well as we them. So this is special case of dialectics that we should pay more close attention to. 

- Every person has his own small world. His views, his dreams, his values etc. we should respect them and understand there inside there is a human being as us which is different in many levels (very many) but eventually is like us.  
- We should learn how to balance between limit setting and help. 
- Communication is reciprocal. The other person is in his reality you in yours. The communication is a contact between those two realities try to meditate when he's trying to say something, there is a reason for it. 
- When we get strong emotional response to something the other said, this is usually a reflection of our emotional state. Try to learn from it, not take it on him. This is an opportunity to learn about oneself (don't confuse this with limit setting). 
- In the same way many times we judge before we learned the detailes, this is also a way we project our believes on others. This is great source of learning, and self awareness. 
- Aware dialog is a technique where we get into slower paste and try to focus solely on the dialog. This is where the dialog becomes meditation, we merge our realities through dialog and not only "having a nice conversation". 

# What you should be moitoring

- You know how to deal with different challenging life situations. When you're bored, anxious, upset etc. 
- Feeling more connected to yourself and belong to this reality. Less validation seeking from outside. 
- Feeling more aware, more relaxed and happy (or controling the amount of those)
- Having more meaning in life 
- When you feel you're changing and you start to notice objective "results". 
- You start to develop intuition or feeling about how much of what you need right now. 
- Feeling progress the oposite of being stuck in one place. 
- Things start to make sense and life start to have order and logic. 
- Having more motivation in life, feeling more alive. 
- Less out of awareness events, and the events are shorter. You feel the captain of your ship.
