### Main practice fundamentals

* Daily practice.

* Learning from mistakes and adapting. 
* On the fly practicing.
* Dialectics. 

#### Daily practice.
* Meditation (14 steps practice)

#### Long range goal setting. 
* Having a good view of core values. Developing the skills to reflect upon them, and adapt them. 
* Finding different goals of different time scale, that correspond with these core values
* Reflecting upon those goals on a regular basis be on track. 
* Using promisses to self as a tool to keep the goals. 

#### Learning from mistakes and adapting. 

* We make a lot of mistakes, without realizing them we will repeat them. We can use reflection and analysis to learn to avoid them. 
* We may change and think differently than previously, we should be able to adapt and change our course toward new destination. 
* While we think we know how we make decisions we usually wrong about that. Learning to make thoughtful decisions is a skill. 

#### On the fly practicing.

* We have constant challenges in our life, we can treat them as mental puzzles reality creates for us. One can develop the skill to view, reflect and adapt different life situations into such puzzles
* We can create exercise from those situations, or on the contrary view every situation as on the fly life leasson to be learned. 
* We can challenge ourself with on the fly challenges which will take little focus but with great value. 
* We can use our meditation practices, to solve and learn in the constant flow of dayly routine. 
* We can also just notice that we couldn't solve the puzzle online, and take it off line (i.e. learning from mistakes). 

#### Dialectics. Learning from resistance. 

* We can learn from books, movies and passive stuff, they can still challenge us intelectually, morally spiritually. 
* Many times other people can challenge us and our world view, we should learn and invest in deep dialogs with others. 
* We sometimes don't understand ourselves. Many times at different mood or state of mind we think different things, this is dialectics inside onself. 
* The reality is sometimes stronger than our assumptions and expectations of it as of ourselves. Reality can challenge us many times more than friends and books and even more than ourselves. This mainly includes new expiriences which we gain through exiting the comfort zone. 

### Main practice through communication 

Other people is a very reach source of self improvement. The different between communication and the other areas is that communication is symmetrical, on the other side there is another conscious entity as we're, that can change us as well as we them. So this is special case of dialectics that we should pay more close attention to. 

- Every person has his own small world. His views, his dreams, his values etc. we should respect them and understand there inside there is a human being as us which is different in many levels (very many) but eventually is like us.  
- We should learn how to balance between limit setting and help. 
- Communication is reciprocal. The other person is in his reality you in yours. The communication is a contact between those two realities try to meditate when he's trying to say something, there is a reason for it. 
- When we get strong emotional response to something the other said, this is usually a reflection of our emotional state. Try to learn from it, not take it on him. This is an opportunity to learn about oneself (don't confuse this with limit setting). 
- In the same way many times we judge before we learned the detailes, this is also a way we project our believes on others. This is great source of learning, and self awareness. 
- Aware dialog is a technique where we get into slower paste and try to focus solely on the dialog. This is where the dialog becomes meditation, we merge our realities through dialog and not only "having a nice conversation". 

### How do you know you're on the right track

- You know how to deal with different challenging life situations. When you're bored, anxious, upset etc. 
- Feeling more connected to yourself and belong to this reality. Less validation seeking from outside. 
- Feeling more aware, more relaxed and happy (or controling the amount of those)
- Having more meaning in life 
- When you feel you're changing and you start to notice objective "results". 
- You start to develop intuition or feeling about how much of what you need right now. 
- Feeling progress the oposite of being stuck in one place. 
- Things start to make sense and life start to have order and logic. 
- Having more motivation in life, feeling more alive. 
- Less out of awareness events, and the events are shorter. You feel the captain of your ship.
