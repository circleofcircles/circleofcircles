## Theory of mind:

I'm one point in space - and this point has physical center. Around this physical center there is a consciousness (a point in infinite space, or universal learner) which allows to create mental models and simulations. 

## The I and the We: 

The border of I and the "outside" is fluid. I can look at my thought as external, at my body as external, or the other people and reality as external. They all can also be internal, and part of some bigger consciousness. 

The idea is to find the balance between the I and the "Other". The I should have some freedom for himself, and the point is to find the optimal balance between the personal I and the others (including I's from different times). 

## Scales:

Different entities live in different time scales. Starting from milliseconds, to billion of years. 
The I is also divisible into small chunks of time. The I lives on scales between milliseconds, to 100 years. The I is part of the whole universe, and we see some "cut" of it at some random point. This cut can be viewed as a frame from movie which lasts billions of years. One can see earth as the place of that movie. 

## Synchronization:

The only issues we have is to synchronize consciousness on different scales. The I should be synced with itself. One should recognize that he is living 80 years and in those years many things happens, and we need to learn synchronize everyone with everyone else inside the I. After that the synchronization with the family members, friends, a small tribe - a country and humanity. Each one of them is living in his cycles of existence. 

One should synchronize himself with maximum things he can influence. Every decision is basically some sort of synchronization attempt with reality or with the other or I in the future.

Synchronization can be done by simple conversation that transfers information from one internal state to another. This is the meaning of language. 

## Reality

Reality can also be viewed as consciousness that behaves in certain way which can be understood by us. And this guy is tough when you ignore him, and quite nice when you don't. Science is the art and language of synchronization with reality. 

## Language 

As physical reality is very harsh, people and livings beings had developed protocols of communication. Those protocols try to synchronize everyone with each other and with reality, to foresee the future events and possibilities and act properly. 

## Economics 

Money it's a way to synchronize consiousness quantitatively - to project priority. It's the way of someone to say - this is what I have, and what I can pay to synchronize myself with reality or with other people. Money should be highly correlated with time for each individual. 

## Ideal reality 

- Everyone should learn minimal language so they can communicate their internal state to others. 
- Reality is synchronized on all scales. When you take some random person from random place at random time - he is cool with where he is. 

## Practice

Time is the only resource you have. Now solve the following question - what is the best way to invest the time, so that I could maximize synchronization with things I prefer to be in reality to make it closer to ideal, for myself and for others (balancing between the two). Make zoom in and zoom out all the time and make sure you're on the right path, as individual and as a collective.
