# More Conclusions from Space of Perspectives

## Spirituality is the wind in this space.

When you walk around, you are always surrounded by air. Usually, you don't notice that it's there, because you're too concentrated on other things, and the air is quite inert. However, if you move fast - run, or ride a bicycle, or a motorcycle - you suddenly have wind hitting your face. You notice this wind, and through it, feel the presence of the air.

Similarly, usually you don't notice that you're standing in a space of perspectives, ever-changing and shifting, because they're too inert. Sometimes, however, you will find yourself moving rapidly through this space. A dramatic event, whether happy or sad, such as a birth or a death, can cause you to change your perspective. A sudden understanding of something profound, that you did not understand before, an epiphany. An attempt to change your behaviour, that you suddenly notice that succeeded. Or a psychadelic experience (see below). In these times, you will feel a "wind" in your face, thus noticing the presence of this space through which you are moving. Such experiences are what is usually called spiritual experiences.

## You can change anything, but not everything.

Your current self, with all it's characteristics and reactions, is a point in the space of perspectives. Throughout your life, you travel through this space, your perspectives ever-changing. Of course, if you are aware of this, you can also affect the direction of this travel. Once you become aware enough of a characteristic you want to change, you can employ various techniques of "inner-work" to change it - push in a specific direction in the space of perspectives. Theoretically speaking, you can change any part of you that you like, given you invest enough effort. On the other hand, this might be quite a lot of effort - and time. Therefore, you are limited in how many different charactersitics you can change, or in other words, with how quickly you can move through this space, during your limited lifespan. The plot of your movement across this space, the set of all perspectives you hold throughout your life, is quite local. This "neighbourhood" in which you move may be referred to as "your true self" - not in way of a predestination, but as acknowledgement of the limitaions of inner-work. So you may change anything, but not everything. This also explains again, why you cannot ever see from the exact perspective of someone else - you cannot move far enough to get to their "neighbourhood", and it's unlikely that you start very close to each other.

## Psychadelics enable rapid changes.
