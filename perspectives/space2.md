# More Conclusions from Space of Perspectives

## Spirituality is the wind in this space.

When you walk around, you are always surrounded by air. Usually, you don't notice that it's there, because you're too concentrated on other things, and the air is quite inert. However, if you move fast - run, or ride a bicycle, or a motorcycle - you suddenly have wind hitting your face. You notice this wind, and through it, feel the presence of the air.

Similarly, usually you don't notice that you're standing in a space of perspectives, ever-changing and shifting, because they're too inert. Sometimes, however, you will find yourself moving rapidly through this space. A dramatic event, whether happy or sad, such as a birth or a death, can cause you to change your perspective. A sudden understanding of something profound, that you did not understand before, an epiphany. An attempt to change your behaviour, that you suddenly notice that succeeded. Or a psychadelic experience (see below). In these times, you will feel a "wind" in your face, thus noticing the presence of this space through which you are moving. Such experiences are what is usually called spiritual experiences.

## You can change anything, but not everything.

## Psychadelics enable rapid changes.
