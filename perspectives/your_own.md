# You Can Only See from Your Own Perspective

## Perspectives

Once we work with the model of there being some external reality, which your subjective reality is related to, we can talk about your reaction, or interpretation of this external reality, and compare it with those of others.
This is to say, we take your subjective reality, and try to break it down along two axes. One of them, is the one common to all entities which exist inside our universe, most people, and we call it the objective reality. The various differences and inagreements (Unzustimmigkeiten) along this axis, owing e.g. to difference in sensing appartuses, are interesting as well, but not within the scope of this chapter.
The other axis, which is unique to each entity, and hopefully encompases all that is unique to its consciousness, we all perspective: the "perspective" through which this entity "experiences" that first axis.

## Only your own

From the above definition follows that your perspective is your own. This is more broad than it seems at first glance. We say that (at least for complex consciousnesses such as those for humans), it is exceedingly unlikely that your perspective will ever be identical to that of anyone else, at any time. This means that your attempts to "understand" other people are limited, intrinstically, by the difference in your perspectives. You are limited to simulating their perception within your subjective reality, employing your experiences to try to approximate theirs. Of course, there are parts which are overlapping - starting with the external reality, possibly extending further (see Continuum of Subjectivity); but something always remains different and therefore unattainable. This limiation is exacerbated by the need to communicate, in order to understand what is this other perspective that you are trying to simulate. So you can actually only approximate your observation of the external "symptoms" of a different perspective. Some of these symptoms are harder to translate than others; for instance behaviour and body gestures need to be compared to known behaviour in other, better known perspectives, which leads to yet anoter level of removal. Words however, attempt to give us a more direct bridge - you don't try to estimate what the other person's perspective is based on their behaviour, rather they're trying to tell us what it is. Words have however other limitations. These will be further discussed in a later chapter (#TODO: add link: Words are based on common experiences).
