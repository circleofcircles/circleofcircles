# You can only see from your own perspective

## Perspectives

Once we work with the model of there being some external reality, which your subjective reality is related to, we can talk about your reaction, or interpretation of this external reality, and compare it with those of others.
This is to say, we take your subjective reality, and try to break it down along two axes. One of them, is the one common to all entities which exist inside our universe, most people, and we call it the objective reality. The various differences and inagreements (Unzustimmigkeiten) along this axis, owing e.g. to difference in sensing appartuses, are interesting as well, but not within the scope of this chapter.
The other axis, which is unique to each entity, and hopefully encompases all that is unique to its consciousness, we all perspective: the "perspective" through which this entity "experiences" that first axis.

## Only your own

From the above definition follows that your perspective is your own. This is more broad than it seems at first glance. We say that (at least for complex consciousnesses such as those for humans), it is exceedingly unlikely that your perspective will ever be identical to that of anyone else, at any time. This means that your attempts to "understand" other people are limited, intrinstically, by the difference in your perspectives. You are limited to simulating their perception within your subjective reality, employing your experiences to try to approximate theirs. Of course, there are parts which are overlapping - starting with the external reality, possibly extending further (see Continuum of Subjectivity); but something always remains different and therefore unattainable. Further limitations to the possibility of understanding will be discussed in later chapters.
