# How to Find Perspectives

## Why do we need more perspectives

Through the previous chapters, we mentioned various things that we can learn to do - understand others better, understand ourselves better, and even change ourselves. All of these things rely on obtaining a better understanding, or better familiarity, with the space of perspectives. Once we are more familiar with it, we have more reference points to use for approximating others or ourselves, and for navigating in it. Such familiarty we can obtain, first and foremost, by observing and, as much as possible, trying out, various perspectives.
