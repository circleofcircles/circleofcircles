"You can only ever see your own perspective. Everything else is approximation and simulation." 

- not so sure. Depends on how you define perspective, but you could agree that on some topics some people have no opinion but list of opinions. You can also asign some propability or plausibility value to each of the perspectives you see on some issue. I think most of the intelegent people who don't see black and white, have a range of opinions on some topics, which sometimes contradicts. 

- also approximation or simulation is not necessarily not correct. When we talk about opinoins for example, you can understand someone opinion very well even if your intuition is different. More than that, you could translate expiriences shared by different people to your own expirinces. So sometimes you get the core feelings of others and sometimes you don't. 

- also something like memory which is by definition a simulation, is still some part of expirience, becuase your current perspective at certain moment is also influenced by some memores knowldge and concepts you learned during your lifetime. 

- My point is that it's fluid. On one hand you have the current moment expirience that you have right now, on the other the whole range of all expirinces of all humanity with their interpretations to the events, and you usually place yourself somewhere in the middle range of it. 

"Reality is subjective"

- Not disagreeing. There is a better definition of it - reality is only what can be expirienced by conscious entities. Just to remove some part of antagonism here. Reality is sensitive topic, and truly irrelevant to vast majority of the things we're talkign about. 

"Other entities are "real" inasmuch you can't simulate them properly" 

- Once again it's fluid. You can't understand and simulate yourself properly most of the time. 

"Space of perspectives" 

- needs to be defined somewhat rigorously. 

"Spirituality is the wind in this space." 

- I like the word game in hebrew, but we should be more precise here. I would emphesize the option of change and control inside this space. I also wouldn't emphesize the spirtuality at first but the path in life as baing exposed to more persepectives and living through more of them. i.e. start from defining some sort of metrics inside this space, and then find a way to connect it to spirituality. 

"You can change anything, but not everything." 

- I think you refer to the fact that the subconscious is much larger than conscious. So you can change in some vectors but the change is limited. 

"Perspectives of non-human entities. They're difficult to empathize, because they're so different." 

- I would start from something which is not that different. Say a video game - you know there is a single creator to the game and you're basically communicating with the creator of the game, but it's a different type of communication - not words but game. How many people design the game is not that important. Or a book which is writen by one person or 1000 what does it matter? 

- Another thought experiment is to think of collective which is expressing ideas as a collective (say by voting). Eventually there is a human there who thinks like that, or few humans that can represent the collective. It's like speaking to different people and make some sort of your own persepective based upon few people. So collective can be reduces to single minded person sometimes. Basically if single person is conscious so the collective is at least as conscious, and probably "super conscious" - i.e. it can represent many conscious entities together. I mean if proffesor is conscious then board of proffesors is probably conscious as well. 

- I sometimes like to talk about an army - where each individual sees himself as part of the whole "organism". So instead of looking at collective as not so different from single minded entity, you can look at it as an organism with it's own hierarchy and priorities.

- As we progress into collective - we can think about genes as entities who are basically the "true entities" which are behind the wheel. Now if you can't accept genes, think of evolution as mind - which instead of imagining probable futures just explores them. In gene space humans are just another antity which is part of the "thinking proccess" which is the evolution. The thought experiment here is to think about an experiment where you live in a world where evrey thought or options of future you explore is actually happening in reality, then when you see the best path, you go there. The mind is basically the same mechanism just using approximation, to simulate the futures.
