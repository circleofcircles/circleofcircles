= Circle of Circles =

The purpose of this repository is to collect various ideas regarding forms of perception, forms of forms, ways of approaching the world, exercsies, theories and spirituality, in a way that attempts to be:

- Concise
- Organized and searchable
- Indexed, containing definitions and approachable to newcomers
- Representive of the complex non-linear structure of the ideas therein

We hope to convey our insights and notions as we perceive them, while also leaving space for various ways of viewing each subject. The more ideas, the merrier, so please contibute whatever thoughts you have, either via PRs or via issues, whichever you are more comfortable with!

Since Hebrew is the mother tongue of most of us, and also the language in which we developed the basics of this approach, we start off by writing in Hebrew. Hopefully we will soon enough translate at least some to English, and of course translations to other languages are welcome - with each translation, you lose something and gain something else.

== Why the circle? ==

This was the first shape of all shapes that Michael brought to discussion, so we remain fond of it. For more, read up on `circle`.
Also, the circle is a truly democratic shape, where all points are symmetrical and all members are equal. We do not want this to be a book that we write and you read, rather an ever-expanding group collaboration, where all readers are also writers.

== Where to start? ==

Well, the structure is non-linear (and hopefully, at least sometimes circular), so there's no fixed starting place. Amos currently recommends starting with `word`, but feel free to start anywhere else. Also, you can test yourself - did you feel an urge to do as told here? Do the oppsoite? Or did you skip this part and went straight to read something?
