Sharing expirience
=====

Although personal science is different from empirical science, we can think of some system that can help to shared, updated and teach personal expiriences to others. Based on assumption that people are not that different at least to some extent, we are seeking to place the art of sharing expiriences or at least their core components, closer to science than to an art. 

One way known to help share some amount of expiriences is practices (like meditation, psycho therapy, or extreme sport) or substances. It could be something as simple as aspirin, which is based on some physiological factors that change the tolerance to pain, or some advanced psychoactive substances like DMT that can take you into another dimension. 

The scientific method
=====

We build our approach on few steps. Every time the step is not working, one should come back to previous steps and improve upon them. 

1. The reproducibility. In this step one should ask himself can he find a way to reproduce the expirience somehow, with some high enough probability? Can he find the circumstances and actions that cause him to be in some specific state of mind? 

2. Definability. In this step the expirience should be rigorously defined, and not to be confused with some other expirience. Wording and explaining the point is encouraged. Here one should also find the balance between getting the point (the core of the expirience) which is above any specific details, and yet having enough structure and bounds to be able to recognize it properly and not to be confused with other terms and expiriences. 

3. Sharability. Find a person who is willing to experience it as well, and make sure you can pass him the expirience. At this stage the most important part is to make that he is not saying what you want to hear on one hand and on the other he got the core expirience. He should at least describe it in his own words. 

4. Consistency - at this stage one should make sure to recognize different "accents" of the expirience, being able to classify them in different people - while trying to be sure the expirience which you want to pass is actually expirienced by others. Some questions and/or tests that might lead you to recognize the quality of expirience by others should be introduced, and you should get statistics of success and failure of the sharability of the expirience. Here you can work as group of people you think got the expirience correctly, one of the tests could be the ability to share the expirience to others without your help. 

5. Exercises. Having a group of people who share an expirience can lead to finding a set of actions and instructions which are independant of anyone who is sharing the expirience first hand i.e. set of exercises and a full path to some larger group of people who can understand and expirience it without the need of a guide, just by reading or watching the trainer/teacher explaining what he's doing and where he's going and what he's expiriencing. 

6. Availability. Although steps 1-5 make the expirience scientific reproducable and sharable expirience, one should always strive to make it more accessible to larger public. The question here is how to remove some complex sticking points where people having hard time to grasp. What is not working and how to improve it? Are there shorter paths to the same place? Is there some shorcuts from other places (i.e. if you grasp some concept or expirience well, maybe it's easier for you to get to a new point).
