1. The reality is a hologram - reconstraction of the input of our senses. The matrix is not only what we see, but also how we think and what we feel (the psychological aspect not only the "reality"). 

2. Memes and many levels of abstraction between the idea - a true reality, and the I - who see the reality through limited tools, and tries to reconstruct it from limited knowledge - from limited perception. Our life is a point in space of lives of characters, we are memes as well, but we interact with other memes with different interfaces some of them are more "real" to us than others. 

3. Time. We load to our mind from the "big knowledge space" only what is needed for the current point. like CPU solving specific task. 
- The future and the past are "near". We forget the long past, and don't see the long future. 
- We move through time, slowly changing states. Me from 20 years ago is not me today almost entirely. 

4. Cicle sizes. It's better to think about ourselves not as linear creature but as an entity repieting itself with different cicle sizes. Like a groundhog day made of consciousness. Sometimes we see it with our own eyes several times, sometimes it's several people each see part of the cicle. I'm a part of genetic life cicle (single cicle). But also single day is a cicle, a year, a generation, a city for example has its own life cicle which is buggen than each person, but several people make it occur. Scientific knowledge is like that. 

5. We are made of things that we pass through them. We are witnesses the I the consciousness is just a witness. The will to change is part of the things that pass through us - it's a program. The witnessing is also a program, but it's a meta-program, a program about programs which run through us. 

6. Virtual concepts living thgought us and becoming more and more real. It's all just about resolution. Consciousness is grasping all reality with certain resolution as well as other consciousnesses.

Exercises: 

1. Recognizing that the recognition comes from us, it's consciousness not "reality". 
2. Recognizing that the "other" is me - I try to reconstruct his internal state from my internal knowledge of states. 
3. The idea is "real" and phisical reality is "imaginary" (in a sense it's just part of ideas).  
4. Each moment is ethernal existance as mathematical possibility. 
5. Seeing things in slow motion feeling the difference. 
6. Practicing to understand higher dimentions (we're in a flat land).
