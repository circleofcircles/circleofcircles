Claim 1: We recognize we're moving in time. We can meditate and find the area of our mind that says to us - time is passing. We can listen to this part of our mind. By listening to part that says - time is passing, we switch to the place where time passes slower because we get out one step "outside" of time scales. If you did the noticing exercise, you know that the speed by which you can say you notice stuff is much slower than you actually noticing stuff. So when you noticing time passage you slow down your subjective perception of time.

Exercise: For 5 minutes meditate that the time is passing. Listen to the "music of time" - notice mainly the fact the time is passing. Make it for 30 seconds several times until you sure your focus is not fading towards other things. Then do this for a minute until you trust yourself your focus isn't changing, then two minutes etc. The focus should be movement in time. 

Claim 2: Now move your hands in periodic movement. Notice how calm you are - how you don't see any problem between the movement and what you see and expect. As a child you learned that. This correlation between the movement and what you see and sense, is what makes the universe "calm" for you. When you don't feel this way, when you feel that what you do is not answered correctly by the universe then you get a feeling that you are strange to the universe. We all try to familiarize ourselves with the universe, and be loyal and open to it and its teachings so that we feel comfortable in it. I'm not saying that feeling comletelly like in a movie without any suffering is the goal, I'm saying that we have some degree of acceptance with the universe we're part of, sometimes people disagree completelly with the universe and how he behaves, this is also ok. People have the right to be whatever they choose to be, I'm saying that if you're calm is basically the other side of the coin of feeling comfortable in the universe - percieving it as positive, and if you're annoyed all the time you percieve the universe as something unpleasant something negative. And the fact you got no strong negative feelings from moving your hands, is showing that this is something which is in agreement between you and your "god" - the universe around you, which is forced upon you. 

Exercise: Start to notice things which you feel secure about and things which you don't feel secure about. Understand that this is basically the same as a quality of prediction of what is probable to happen. Not knowing the future or having limited control over it is the same as suffering. Of course having negative expirience and expectation of the universe is also possible, and it's also expected negative i.e. suffering. The basic thing is to notice your mind is making predictions of what is going to happen and takes action accordingly. It also has some evaluation of the situation in some many dimentional space, and it takes actions acourding to some optimization function, one important factor of which is the expected negative or positive consequences of the action.
