Contemplation 
=====

Many people know what meditation is - at least in a classical sense. You sit, you try to observe and not think, maybe think a little bit while observing the thinking and not "falling" into it (becoming the thinking). This is very clear exercise - maybe not simple to implement and it takes years to be true observer, but the direction on how to do and what to do is clear. Just sit and observe - whatewer this means to you. When you noticed you fall into illusion by the observation, fall back into being observer. 

Exercise for 1 minute. Try to observe and not fall into the observation i.e. don't fully believing this is the reality. When you notice you fell into the observation, get out of there, to your center. 

But not so many people know that contemplation is also something very educational, which can be learned, and be not less "meditative" and mind transforming. The execrices for contemplation are much dependant on your knowledge of any specific subject, but proper contemplation can (and should) be practiced not less than meditation. Meditation in many ways is an exercise which only shows how good you do this exercise and only it. Like some specific dimention which doesn't requere any knowledge only practice and this is why people attracted to it. Yet contemplation in my opinion is where the western energy goes, and I mean what people actually doing is thinking, today many people have very complex ideas on many subjects, so this means people are prefereing to contemplate over meditate to feel the energy flowing through them. Contemplation as well can be practiced and learned to benefit many important mind properties, which basically makes every moment of existance more "fulfilling". More than that contemplation can bring you to very new places where meditation would never brought you, this is basically an exercise which should be done because you are a human being - that wants to make sense of reality around him. This is much more basic than meditation which is only an exercise you do to "practice" something - maybe important but not existential necessary. Contemplating is essential and existantial, otherwise you as a person will do very shallow and random stuff with your life. Contemplation is something everyone need, and not many know how to do. 

What is contemplation?
========

Contemplation can be formulated as feeling what the idea says to me personaly. Unlike logical thinking which tries to make a barrier between the self and the idea - be "objective", observe from the outside - contemplation is about observing from the "inside". 

We can start from observing the difference in reaction when we see someone else is in trouble and when we are in trouble. When the information conserning the self, we can't stay "neutral" - just by definition. This proccess of having "internal" view of idea differs troumendesly from having an objective knowldge about the idea from "outside". So how is this happens? And why contemplation? 

When we know some simple and immediate knowledge that concerns us we don't need to contemplate because it's immediate - we feel it very strongly. But many times without contemplating, some knowledge that concerns us can be ignored, not realized or simply missed. Contemplating is sort of meditating, but it also can be done by thought experiments that help us to grasp how some idea concerns us. 

Techniques
=======

Many techniques exist to contemplate - and basically it depens on a person, because no "idea" that comes from the outside can be felt from the inside without the will of the subject to relate the "content" of the idea to himself and his life. Many times contemplation is also not about the self immediatly - contemplation is about trying to "relate" to some subject at hand, to try and feel how it feels to understand it from the "inside". Then somehow it becomes clear that the idea has a relation to him. 

Exercises
===== 

- Start to hunt good conmpletional thoughts (write good contemplations in a diery). 
- Try to find your own formula to contemplate. To look at a subject from new different angle, and relate it to yourself.
