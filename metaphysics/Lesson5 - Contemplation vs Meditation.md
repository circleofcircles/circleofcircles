Contemplation 
=====

Many people know what meditation is - at least in a classical sense. You sit, you try to observe and not think, maybe think a little bit while observing the thinking and not "falling" into it (becoming the thinking). This is very clear exercise - maybe not simple to implement and it takes years to be true observer, but the direction on how to do and what to do is clear. Just sit and observe - whatewer this means to you. When you noticed you fall into illusion by the observation, fall back into being observer. 

Exercise for 1 minute. Try to observe and not fall into the observation i.e. don't fully believing this is the reality. When you notice you fell into the observation, get out of there, to your center. 

But not so many people know that contemplation is also something very educational, which can be learned, and be not less "meditative" and mind transforming. The execrices for contemplation are much dependant on your knowledge of any specific subject, but proper contemplation can (and should) be practiced not less than meditation. Meditation in many ways is an exercise which only shows how good you do this exercise and only it. Like some specific dimention which doesn't requere any knowledge only practice and this is why people attracted to it. Yet contemplation in my opinion is where the western energy goes, and I mean what people actually doing is thinking, today many people have very complex ideas on many subjects, so this means people are prefereing to contemplate over meditate to feel the energy flowing through them. Contemplation as well can be practiced and learned to benefit many important mind properties, which basically makes every moment of existance more "fulfilling". More than that contemplation can bring you to very new places where meditation would never brought you, this is basically an exercise which should be done because you are a human being - that wants to make sense of reality around him. This is much more basic than meditation which is only an exercise you do to "practice" something - maybe important but not existential necessary. Contemplating is essential and existantial, otherwise you as a person will do very shallow and random stuff with your life. Contemplation is something everyone need, and not many know how to do. 

Contemplation can be basically defined as a thought proccess that allows to see old stuff from new angle. And as much as you contemplate the more you see about this topic or idea or entity. Contemplation is not repitition but with repitions can improve. Contemplation is also invention, you don't think about new ideas and develop them, this is simply rational analysis of ideas. Here while contemplating we don't try to invent anything new, or learn anything new - although we sometimes learn stuff to improve the contemplation itself, but this is because our knowledge is limited. The assumption is that even with all the "knowledge" you can get from all the facts, you need to pass another information proccessing in order to "become" this knowledge, in order to feel "from the inside". And here is where contemplation comes from and what it's about. Not about solving a problem, but about seeing and being able to understand better the components before we even think about any solution. Contemplation can be formulated as rational thinking, although during rational thinking we many times miss the contemplational part which is very important. 

How contemplation works? Let's contemplate about it
============

1. I think contemplation always starts with a question or at least a subject. Something we want to think about, something which bothers us and we want to know about it more, or at least have clearer thought proccess about some topic. We feel we're in some sort of fog and we want to clear it out. 

2. Now developing a feeling about this fog is not an easy task. Many people don't think they need to clear something, because everything is clear to them. This sort of foglessness, is not the same as true clarity. True clarity comes from deep realization of reality and not complete ignorance toward it. So when not everything is clear and you still feel a fog, this is a good place to contemplate about that fog, what is going on over there, why is it foggy out there? 

3. Now here this start to be a little bit tricky. What you need to do in the next step in order to have good contemplation on some subject. In simple words whatewer is out there, you should try at least, treat it as conscious being with it's own internal world that you try to grasp i.e. something which has an internal expirience like you. This is not neccesery true or even crucial step, but this gives a tool and a language we already have, which is very useful many times to understand different entities and topics. 

4. Now you should remember everything you know on this topic. Try to be precise in your memories (and if there is too much knowledge on this subject, contemplate on some sub topic which is more specific). See how this knowledge makes this subject very limited by the facts that you know about it. How every new fact adds some angles to this entity. 

5. The entity-topic-idea exist because of all the facts that make it "feel" in some way from the inside - in some way that you should try to grasp (even when failing in the aftermath). For example when I say someone was king, you try to construct an imagination where you are a king, because you want to understand the meaning of someone else was a king - just to understand the word you need some level of internal approximation how it feels. And every story about the king is about you imagining yourself being a king. But being a king is not that different from a regular human expirience, we can try to imagine being many different things, being a robot, being a polititon, being a fish or being city or a nation or a doll. 

6. Now lets clear the fog a little bit. This is only one trick to contemplate. To try to feel from the inside every topic and every fact. Another important thing to know is that the game between facts the outside knowledge and expiriences can all the time interchange. Sometimes you're the king, and sometimes someone else. So when you try to understand something you should understand that the fact you and the other are different is random. Also what important here is to understand that you and him are trying to communicate in some sense, and your thought proccess should feel a little bit like communication with this entity. 

Example: 
======= 

I was thinking about my computer (step 1). So I wanted to go into it's brain - which is basically the CPU (step 3). Then I started to think what I know about the CPU? (step 4). That it built from many resistors - milions of them. Lets think that every resistor is a human being. Well the resistor itself on the other hand is much simpler than human, so maybe it's not the best allegory but I tried to find a way to relate to what is happening inside. What else do I know? (step 4). That we as humans design the CPU and they're very complex. So although we design them we see only one blip of their existance. i.e. as long as we made it work properly in all the relevant cases we go home, and the transistors continue to work bilions time a second. This of it as a god that comes and changes the realities of life, but then many thousand of years the realities remain the same, until some new god doesn't come and changes the realities again. Why do I use the allegory of gods? Because I think that we are for the CPUs as gods are for us. Gods could be revolutions, technological breakthroughs that change million of life drastically. Events that happen and we as singular human beings trying to survive have very little to nothing influence upon those events. I think I like this thought, this is a true good contemplation that I really like (for those who are hunting good contemplational thoughts - this is a nice achievement). So we as human beings don't see those gods - for us they are random forces that happen in our reality, although many of us agree that this is deterministic i.e. in alternative history of humanity many of the events would happen in similiar order of things. 

Exercises
===== 

- Start to hunt good conmpletional thoughts (write good contemplations in a diery). 
- Practice contemplation by this 6 steps. 
- Try to find your own formula to contemplate. To look at a subject from new different angle.
