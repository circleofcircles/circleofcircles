Claim 1: There is an ability to state things about percieving things (like a simple state that I percieve a chair  I'm not only seeing a chair, I also see that I exist, and I percieve something). This ability is reflecting something which exist and we know about it some different stuff (about the I) - at least its own existance (that there is a meta entity which exists not only the entity itself - like not only a chair but also I, we can say there is not only I as chair (a model) but also I that percieves the I (we have the "right" of always jumping one level up - so the absolute I is the place where this series of I's converges). 

Claim 2: We can claim valid to some extent claims not only about the perception but also about the perciever. The one who tries to claim the claims is always trying to rise one level "above" and be "objective" but this "climb up" is also an operation of the same "mind". So this climb up, is from one hand a way to be "above" the reality, and on the other hand it realises it's also a part of the same reality. 

Simple claim: we can notice that we notice. Counsseness is about noticing spiral of always trying to rise above to see the other "objectively" i.e. without a distortion. A very special case of noticing, is with people who are already noticing so they are already in this spiral. So to predict them, one needs much more cicles than average complexity perception. So the stone is much simpler to predict than a human, but we also can say that we don't know the reaction of a human to some extent. For example we don't think the human around us will jump on us with knife or will jump on one leg and start yelling etc. so we do have some reasonable percieption of other person. Maybe not to the level that we can predict him in very high resolution but we can say the unknown is in some range of behaviours. On the other hand, if the person is very hard to predict what he's gonna do, the unkown could be very big. Much bigger than in simple cases. 

Simple claim 2: Now there are people that notice they are noticing, so their internal world is quete complex, so in order to understand their behavious we need a very complex internal model of them, maybe more complex than the rest of the world, bacause their internal world is much less predictible than behviours of stones or planes or simple people that behave very predictibly. 

Simple claim 3: And this is the simple premise that we anyway percieve our reality with limited resolution. Everything we know about our soroundings, is limited to some resolution, which we know can be larger in several orders of magnitude. So if everything we know about anything not only other people but other objects other creatures and even ourselves we know to some limited extent, so imaginary objects are also objects with some limited resolution in some high dimentional space which we percieve in some resultion but the resolution is in some other dimentions. For example we know that one person has one history, imaginary objects can have several interpretations or lives or continuations. Basically if we accept the many world interpretation the person has all quantum continuations of himself, so basically we are also imaginary creatures but for some reason we don't percieve that this way, and we percieve ourselves as "rea" and everything which is not like us imaginary. 

Exercises

1. When you look at your environment instead of saying: chair, table, spoon, start saying: I notice a chair, I notice a table, I notice a spoon. This exercise is succesful if you start to feel to some extent that the objecs around you are part of your perception, of a hologram your mind is creating for you. 

1.1. Now when 1. is natural start saying: I notice that I noticed a chair, I noticed that I noticed the table. Here is very important not to be in a hurry and actually feel that I not only noticed, but also I noticed that I notice. Here the success would be when you start to notice more and more "internal" psychological stuff which drive your behaviour. 

1.2 Now there is no need to make more I noticed levels unless you feel like it, make several levels just for practive. You can also just repeat it like a mantra, and feel it: 

I noticed that:

I noticed that: 

I noticed that:

....

The success here is when you feel the "I notice" the new level as some sort of "feeling" that you can get deeper or shallow as you wish. Basically here you develop the feeling of noticing, it's like a muscle that you feel you can develop. 

2. Now notice that noticing to notice is the other side of not noticing at all. You can notice, you can notice to notice, and you can not notice at all. This is part of the same procedure. Noticing is not better than not noticing, you're just using your mind to proccess information around you to behave optimally. Is this claim itself correct? Or the claim of noticing noticing? Am I trying now to notice something new, is this another way of noticing? Or maybe there is only one way to notice stuff? is this a climb up or maybe alternative claim? how do we know to prefer up over down? Am I trying to get up now or is it just another side of the same? Maybe we're not getting up we are always stuck in the same level which is "my mind" of each of us? 

3. Watch some people behaviours, can you predict what they gonna do? Is it always the case? Who you have harder time to predict his behaviours, in what situations this happens and why? Who are the people you try to predict their behaviour? Why are you trying to predict their behaviour and how succesful you are? Who are the people that cross your mind and why?

4. Are there some people you can't predict what they gonna do? Maybe some people are more predictable to you than others? 

5. Take a thing you percieved (a chair). Now feel that you gave it a name, you also know how it looks with some resolution, but you know very little truly about it. You know for example there is a very small chance the chair will jump at you and will eat you, but you don't know about that molecular soup at that point of space much. 

5.1 Now think about an imaginary entity - like a meme (for example cinderella). Think that you know about her some stuff, with some resolution, maybe she has several versions, or several stories but you know the "idea" of this entity. Now think that this idea is real in the same sense the chair is real. You know about both of the some information, and you intract with them in different ways, and their perceptions i.e. the interface with them is very different, but eventually they belong to the same reality, but you see them with resolution in different spaces. All you know about something is some very limited mental representation of them. To make things more continious think that a person from a long past (like Cleopatra), is more of a meme to you than a reality. When something is getting toward you in the present moment the more it becomes "real" - but you're in a random point in space and time, so this distinction is illusory - "reality" is only you being here and now, not something "outside".
