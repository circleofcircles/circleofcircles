Suffering
====== 

One of many fears of many people is physical suffering. Ancient people realized this (as probably the physical suffering then was much more common than today) and developed special techniques to address this fear. Even Buddha has been said to practice a lot of ascetic practices. I think that although today this is much less prominent fear (as you can always simply take pain killers), the techniques and the basic principles of mechanics of the mind are much more clear and become much more “impressive” when you see you can reach some “physical” results using your mind alone. 

Our mind has very distinctive differentiation between ideas and opinion and “serious stuff” like survival, suffering. People tend to agree or even practice many meditations like being in now and reality is illusion etc. but when it comes to the “serious” problems, which basically come down to suffering they take it very seriously (as they probably should). They forget everything and approach “reality” as completely real forgetting all the nice “ideas” they learned and even practiced because they really afraid of suffering. 

The solution
=======

Many ascetic practices are addressing this in a very simple and easy to grasp way. You get used to suffering - you learn to control your suffering. Basically suffering is something which can be formulated as an overwhelmingly intense physical feeling which is way beyond the mind can handle in certain moment. It’s like trying to lift a too heavy weight with no practice - and your psyche gets “injured” or traumatize. Basically we are not afraid of the suffering per se, but of this trauma which caused by extensive physical intensity which we’re not capable to handle mentally because we’re overwhelmed. 

So the answer to this issue is very similar to other physical limitation we have - we simply practice, and when the time comes we are at the least more prepared than if we would not practice at all. The practices include increasing the intensity step by step up until we feel we can handle quite harsh conditions which will not overwhelm us but will challenge us. 

While you practice asceticism - even when you get challenged by different problems in your life you start to develop sense of calmness. Even if sometimes the problems overwhelm you, you realize that this is lack of practicing - this is something which is too demanding and life is sometimes not easy, yet you see that this is the only problem - and this helps you to realize that even the problems which do overwhelm you now are only in your head and caused mainly due to lack of practicing and not due to their “reality”. 

Asceticism in the 21st century
======

I think life in the 21st century are not suffering less. We need to put some effort at least to eat healthy food, do some exercises, manage relationships, force ourselves to do some effort. Everything that we should do and not doing (procrastinating) can be interpreted as some sort of suffering. You can find in every aspect of this which you might be missing a way that asceticism can help you to learn to deal with. 

So I developed a simple 5 steps program to practice asceticism in this context. 

Step 1: Choosing. First of all one should choose a theme to do something he doesn’t like or doesn’t enjoy or feel “bad” about. It could be some action (washing dishes for example), or innaction (not overeating or not drinking for example). Don’t worry you will not stop enjoying life - the goal here is practice not to make you suffering without control. 

Step 2: Framing. Now when the subject is chosen one should approach it not as something which is taken from them or forced upon them, but as a game - as an exercise in asceticism. This is very important because you could miss the point here - this is not a program to quit smoking and make more exercise, this is a program directed to introduce you to controlled suffering. 

Step 3: Playing with it. Now start to force yourself to do it (or delay the action you want to do) up until you feel uncomfortable and overwhelmed. You can use timer to check out how long you “hold on” each time. Think of it as a game, as something which is not “serious” something which helps you to explore your limits by doing something crazy. This is a game not a “real” thing. 

Step 4: Improve at the game. Try every time improve a little bit more (please be careful - don’t harm yourself because you wanted to break some crazy record, you will miss the point of the exercise). The point here is to gradually getting used to the idea that “suffering” is not the same as “something bad”. And that you can develop this as a muscle and enjoy the process. 

Step 5: Challenge yourself. Here the point is to find new themes to focus on after you somehow got into plateau in previous theme. Try to find new things that can challenge you that will also benefit your positive and healthy habits (or reduce the negative ones). Expand to other areas, sometimes plateau means you are just not experienced enough. 

Just to practice
======

Another approach could be doing something pointless at first - only in order to practice asceticism, but on the way. This is a good idea because even if you forget to force yourself in some beneficial areas of your life, you can always do something useless on the way. This will always also remind you about the other stuff you should be practicing. Having some such habits usually require very little effort or focus on asceticism while still practising it to some extent. 

For example I’m always trying to get myself to wear a little bit less than I need to feel warm in winter. This causes me to get used to cold (I live in a place where you basically can’t die or freeze something from cold in winter, this is not a good advice if you live in northern countries - try summer instead). The point being is that I don’t pay a lot of attention to this practice, it's just there and I’m doing it when I need to get outside. 

You can always find more and more ways to be masochistic a little bit toward yourself in order to be more resilient. 

Conclusion
==== 

The  main idea here is to understand that this practice even exist, that you can benefit something by practicing it to some extent you chose fit, and that this will reduce your fears and stress because what’s the worst that can happen? You will have some resilience which could prove beneficial in some cases of your life. 

Some monks reach some insane level where they can handle relatively calmly some crazy intense suffering - like burning alive. This is definitely very impressive, and the fact they can reach this level should show us that we can at least practice and reach some basic levels where we simply don’t get scared or get into panic from small daily routine sufferings which happens all the time. Everything is in our head - and we know we have the ability to achieve this understanding completely. And even if we don’t get to this levels, we still can accept some “regular” levels of suffering and be more relax in our lives.
