Noticing the other as I
=======

We as humans have an organ in our brain which makes us automatically feel what others that we recognize as “like us” feel. We basically all the time place ourselves in place of the other human being, sometimes animal, robots, dolls or even abstract concepts as football teams, nations, imaginary characters. We have the basic ability to simulate ourselves in their place. 

The first and the most profound realization here is to understand that we tend to picture the other in our image. We actually have hard time to realize that there can be actually something extremely different inside other consciousness that we even don’t suspect. 

If a person is blind he will not realize how is it possible to anyone else to see. If someone never experienced anger, he will have no internal reference for how does it feels to be angry, and he will see an angry person he will probably understand how angry people behave and what they say, but he would have hard time to relate to the feeling and thus to understand how it feels to be angry (he will see the mechanics but will fail to understand it from the inside). More than that when we see someone hurt, we think they experience the pain the same way we experience pain, and when we hurt. But this is not necessarily true many times - people have different internal experiences of many different things. 

You can basically realize that what you see is not other people - what you see is basically you, trying to realize how YOU would feel on their place if YOU would be them. 

Exercise: Communicate with other people, and see how you basically assume they are like you. Think they also see you as basically them. 

Although we have no good internal reference to others, with conversations and a lot of exploration of other’s experiences we can recognize more and more that our realities and internal experiences are quite different. This is very hard to grasp, and some people grasp this better than others. 

Exercise: Try to communicate with other people, and try to grasp how different their experience from yours. 

The most interesting notion to explore historically in this sense is how different cultures grasp the concept of god or the divine in their own image. 

Exercise: check out the spirits of many natives, the polytheistic beliefs, the biblical god. See how human they are and Gods and spirits worldviews, are in many ways projection of the cultural values and notion into those “imaginary” entities. 

Expanding the I
======

Another interesting direction to explore in this sense is how far away can we go in this exercise? What we can possibly imagine as being conscious and we can sensibly place ourselves in their shoes? Even with other human beings it’s sometimes hard. We have hard time to understand what is going in the mind of people who we perceive as “bad” or “evil”. We also have hard time to grasp the life of people who are extremely different than we are, exactly because they are people like us - we have this barrier of understanding. 

Another direction to explore is animals and fictional characters. I think we have very natural tendency to place ourselves in their shoes, while we realize this operation (thinking how is to be a cat or how is to be a superman) maybe invalid - that means that we could be completely wrong because they are too different than we are. 

Exercise: watch national geographics and other movies from animal kingdom. See how you try to place yourself in their place but you feel the limit of this possibility. 

Exercise: watch some movie, and see how you tend to place yourself in the place of the fictional characters yet still you are more distant from them. You don’t feel this is real - you think it’s just a movie. 

Evolution as being
===== 

Another step to expand the horizons of the I, is to try to see evolution as optimization solved somewhat differently than “internally”. We as human “think” by imagining. We try to predict in our imagination what will occur - and then we chose the optimal path of action. Our mind is always trying to predict what will happen, and what is the optimal course of action in every situation. Now imagine that you could do all those things with many variations, and instead of imagining actually choosing the best action after many failed trials. 

Think that evolution is doing exactly that. It’s an entity that makes a lot of trials and every generation is choosing the fittest. So we can see the species or the groups that evolve as conscious entities that all the time try to “choose the best path” of actions, in similar situations. We as well are many times act upon our knowledge of situations, and try using memory and imagination to optimize our actions. So although somewhat different mechanism the species as a whole behave in somewhat similar to our mind - but because it’s built differently it can allow itself to be and fail instead to imagine. 

Exercise: try to see the evolution as an organism with many personalities which is trying to “realize” itself. Start from the first self replicator, and move on to the more complex organism. Think about the personality split when to species start to be seperated. Place yourself in its place. 

Exercise: try to feel yourself as part of some bigger organism which is all the living organisms. Your life for him is small trial of possibility which he explores as possibility, in yet another millionths iteration. 

Designed objects as evolutionary entities
====== 

Let’s take a pen or any other object. How did it got here? Why this shape and this design? Obviously many other designs where possible but you bought (or someone else bought) exactly that one. Probably because it has some appeal. We are evolution catalyzers for the objects around us - which as a collective are basically evolving in similar way to live organism. 

Exercise: try to feel everything around you as conscious being. Inanimate objects or memes as another iteration of design, other characters and animals and humans everyone are part of many conscious entities. Everything around us is “thinking” is trying to improve, is moving from moment to moment to somewhat better place - trying to get from potential to being.
